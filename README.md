# This is a simple approach that improves and diversifies the gameplay in the generally available Boss Room project from Unity.
###  
<br>
My changes added to the project:
- Mana system operating in CO-OP, mana is consumed by using skills, and displayed in the UI on the player and allies HUD.
- A new skill called 'ManaRegen' has been added for the Mage character
- The skill allows you to regenerate mana for the main player and allies who are at the appropriate distance, the skill effect is applied for X seconds every Y seconds, and all parameters can be changed in the skill file configuration.
